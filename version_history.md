Version History Debug Analysis & Documentation
📊 CURRENT STATUS SUMMARY
✅ WHAT IS WORKING
Based on the logs from lines 290-296, the core functionality is FULLY OPERATIONAL:

Button Click Detection ✅ - Version history button triggers correctly
Sheet Presentation ✅ - SwiftUI sheet system activates (lines 283-284, 299, 311)
VersionBrowser Initialization ✅ - View appears and onAppear fires (line 290)
File Path Resolution ✅ - Correct file path /Users/saadmomin/Desktop/manual2/app_test_1.txt (line 291)
Data Loading Process ✅ - loadVersions() executes successfully (lines 294-295)
Version Discovery ✅ - 5 versions found and loaded (line 296)
❌ THE PROBLEM
UI Rendering Issue: Data loads successfully but versions are not displaying in the user interface.

🎯 ROOT CAUSE HYPOTHESIS
The issue is UI State Management - the @State var versions array is being populated, but the SwiftUI view is not re-rendering to display the updated data.

Possible Causes:
State Update Threading - loadVersions() might be updating on background thread
SwiftUI Binding Issue - View not observing state changes properly
UI Logic Error - Conditional rendering logic showing wrong state
Race Condition - UI renders before data loading completes
