# Augment App - Project Context & Development History

## 🎯 Project Overview

**Augment** is a comprehensive macOS document versioning application that solves the "final_final.docx" problem by providing automatic file versioning, complete version history, and advanced file management capabilities. The app creates "spaces" (monitored directories) where files are automatically versioned when modified, with full diff viewing, rollback functionality, and search capabilities.

### Core Features ✅ FULLY IMPLEMENTED
- **Automatic File Versioning**: Files are versioned automatically when saved with intelligent throttling
- **Comprehensive Version History**: Complete timeline view with timestamps, comments, and metadata
- **Advanced Diff Engine**: Side-by-side comparison for text, image, and binary files
- **Safe File Rollback**: Restore any file to previous versions with automatic backup creation
- **Space Management**: Create and manage monitored directories with tabbed interface
- **File System Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring of file changes with FSEvents integration (CRASH-FREE ✅)
- **Integrated Search**: Cross-space file search with version information display
- **Crash-Free Operation**: Robust file monitoring without app crashes (thread-safe implementation)
- **Modern UI**: Native SwiftUI interface with complete view hierarchy
- **Finder Integration**: Right-click "Version History" service launches main app's VersionBrowser
- **Permission Management**: Proper macOS sandbox permissions with security-scoped resources
- **Memory Safety**: Enhanced pointer validation and error handling in FSEvents processing
- **Thread Safety**: Concurrent dispatch queues with proper synchronization

## 🔧 Major Issues Resolved

### 1. ✅ Runtime Crashes (FileSystemMonitor) - COMPLETELY FIXED
**Problem**: App crashed with segmentation faults when files were modified in monitored spaces
**Root Cause**: Unsafe memory access in FSEvents callback processing and invalid pointer handling
**Solution**:
- **Enhanced Memory Safety**: Added comprehensive null pointer checks for event paths
- **Safe String Creation**: Proper validation before creating strings from C pointers
- **Error Handling**: Wrapped critical sections in try-catch blocks with graceful error recovery
- **Thread Safety**: Improved autoreleasepool usage and background queue error handling
- **Crash Prevention**: Added FileSystemMonitorError enum for proper error types
- **Throttling**: Maintained 5-second cooldown to prevent version spam
- **Result**: App now runs stably without segmentation faults - CRASH-FREE OPERATION ✅

### 2. ✅ SearchEngine Thread Safety - COMPLETELY FIXED
**Problem**: App crashed during space indexing operations
**Root Cause**: Race conditions in concurrent space indexing
**Solution**:
- Implemented concurrent dispatch queues for thread safety
- Changed concurrent space indexing to serial processing
- Added proper synchronization mechanisms
- **Result**: Search operations now run without crashes

### 3. ✅ Compilation Errors - COMPLETELY FIXED
**Problem**: Multiple compilation errors preventing build
**Root Causes**:
- Missing type definitions (AugmentSpace, FileItem)
- Incorrect module imports (import AugmentCore)
- Duplicate type definitions
- Protocol conformance issues

**Solutions**:
- Created missing types: AugmentSpace.swift, FileItem.swift
- Removed incorrect imports (no separate modules)
- Resolved duplicate definitions
- Added proper protocol conformance (Codable, Hashable)
- **Result**: Clean builds with only minor warnings

### 4. ✅ Permission Issues - COMPLETELY FIXED
**Problem**: App couldn't access user-selected folders
**Solution**:
- Added proper entitlements in Augment.entitlements
- Implemented security-scoped resources
- Added bookmark persistence for folder access
- **Result**: Full file system access with proper security

### 5. ✅ Version History UI Issues - COMPLETELY FIXED
**Problem**: "View Version History" showed placeholder text instead of VersionBrowser
**Root Cause**: Missing navigation context and sheet presentation issues
**Solution**:
- Enhanced sheet presentation with NavigationView wrapper
- Added proper close buttons and error handling
- Implemented comprehensive debug logging
- **Result**: Fully functional version history access through UI

## 🛠️ Build & Development

### Building the App
```bash
# Build from command line
xcodebuild -project Augment.xcodeproj -scheme Augment -configuration Debug build

# Install to Applications
cp -R "DerivedData/.../Augment.app" /Applications/

# Launch app
open /Applications/Augment.app
```

### Development Notes
- **Use Xcode for development**: `open Augment.xcodeproj`
- **Don't run single Swift files**: `swift ContentView.swift` will fail (expected)
- **All types are in same target**: No imports needed between project files
- **File monitoring is crash-free**: Fixed segmentation faults

## 🔒 Security & Permissions

### Required Entitlements
```xml
<key>com.apple.security.files.user-selected.read-write</key>
<key>com.apple.security.files.downloads.read-write</key>
<key>com.apple.security.temporary-exception.files.absolute-path.read-write</key>
```

### Permission Flow
1. User selects folder via file picker
2. App requests security-scoped resource access
3. Bookmark created for persistent access
4. File monitoring starts automatically

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### "Cannot find type 'AugmentSpace'" when running swift command
**Cause**: Running single Swift file without project context
**Solution**: Use Xcode build system, not standalone swift command

### App crashes when editing files
